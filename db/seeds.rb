# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   movies = Movie.create([{ name: 'Star Wars' }, { name: 'Lord of the Rings' }])
#   Character.create(name: 'Luke', movie: movies.first)

# 10.times do
#   VideoGame.create!(
#     title: Faker::Game.title,
#     description: Faker::Game.genre,
#     price: Faker::Number.between(from: 10, to: 100),
#     rating: ["E", "T", "M"].sample
#     )
